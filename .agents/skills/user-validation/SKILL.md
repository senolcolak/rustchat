# User Validation

Use this skill for feature delivery that requires explicit user approval before implementation.

## Default Working Files

- `SPEC.md` at repository root.
- `task_plan.md` at repository root.

Use alternative locations only if the user explicitly requests it.

## Phase 1: Requirement

1. Research the current implementation and constraints.
2. Draft `SPEC.md` with:
   - problem statement
   - goals and non-goals
   - scope and contract impact
   - implementation outline
   - verification plan

No implementation edits are allowed before `SPEC.md` exists.

## Phase 2: Validation Gate

After drafting `SPEC.md`, pause and ask exactly:

`Does this plan meet your expectations? Please approve or provide feedback.`

No code should be written until the user gives explicit approval.

## Phase 3: Verification

After implementation:

1. Update `task_plan.md` with task status and mark it ready for testing.
2. Provide at least one manual verification command for user acceptance (for example a `curl` request).
3. Summarize expected vs actual behavior and list any known limitations.

## Completion Criteria

- `SPEC.md` approved by the user before coding.
- `task_plan.md` reflects final execution status.
- Manual verification command provided and aligned with implemented behavior.
