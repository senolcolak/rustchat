> **📁 MOVED TO SUPERPOWERS STRUCTURE**
> This spec has been restructured to: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-13-platform-foundation-design.md`

**Feature Branch**: `001-platform-foundation`
**Created**: 2026-03-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Platform architecture specification covering technology stack, scalability, agent integration, APIs, and SaaS maturity lifecycle

---

## Data Sovereignty *(mandatory per Constitution X)*

**External Dependencies**: Required (opt-in configurable)

**Network Egress**:
- Core messaging: None (air-gapped capable)
- AI/Agent features: Opt-in (MCP/A2A external connections)
- Search: AWS OpenSearch (opt-in for >5M posts)
- Authentication: IdP-dependent (OIDC/SAML)

**Data Locality**:
- Data stored in: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (ephemeral), S3-compatible (files)
- Cross-boundary data flow: AI agent context (user-approved), search index (if OpenSearch enabled)

**Multi-tenant Impact**: High
- Tenant isolation: Database-level (schema separation or instance isolation)
- Cross-tenant data: Strictly prohibited

---

## Mobile Alignment *(mandatory per Constitution VI)*

**Mobile Compatibility Impact**: High

**Mobile-Specific Considerations**:
- API v4 endpoints affected: All (Mattermost compatibility layer)
- WebSocket events affected: Presence, messaging, notifications, calls
- Calls plugin impact: WebRTC SFU integration
- Mobile journey verification: Login, Channels, Posts, Notifications, Files, Calls

**Upstream Evidence**:
- Mattermost server version analyzed: 9.4.0
- Mobile client: mattermost-mobile (rebranded RustChat Mobile)
- Compatibility strategy: API v4 parity with native extensions

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Core Messaging at Scale (Priority: P1)

Users can send and receive messages in real-time across channels with p99 latency under 150ms, supporting 50,000-200,000 concurrent users with horizontal scalability.

**Why this priority**: Core product functionality; without reliable messaging, no other features matter.

**Independent Test**: Load test with 10,000 concurrent connections, verify p99 latency < 150ms for message delivery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 50,000 concurrent users in channels, **When** a user sends a message, **Then** 99% of recipients receive it within 150ms
2. **Given** a channel with 10,000 members, **When** a message is broadcast, **Then** fan-out completes via Kafka with <5ms latency
3. **Given** morning spike of 30 logins/second, **When** 150,000 users authenticate in 90 minutes, **Then** no authentication failures or degraded performance

---

### User Story 2 - Enterprise SSO Integration (Priority: P1)

Enterprise users authenticate via their existing IdP (SAML 2.0 or OIDC with PKCE) without creating local passwords.

**Why this priority**: Enterprise adoption blocker; federated identity is Constitution XIV requirement.

**Independent Test**: Configure OIDC with test IdP, verify PKCE flow, SAML with signature validation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an OIDC-enabled IdP, **When** a user logs in via SPA, **Then** PKCE is enforced and session established
2. **Given** a SAML 2.0 IdP, **When** a user authenticates, **Then** assertion is validated against XML signature wrapping attacks
3. **Given** SSO configuration, **When** local password auth is disabled, **Then** only federated login is available

---

### User Story 3 - AI Agent Integration via MCP (Priority: P2)

AI agents can securely access enterprise data sources through MCP (Model Context Protocol) with user-delegated permissions, operating under zero-trust principles.

**Why this priority**: Strategic differentiation; enables sovereign AI without data leakage.

**Independent Test**: Deploy MCP server, connect to sample data source, verify JSON-RPC communication and permission scoping.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an MCP server for a data source, **When** an agent requests access, **Then** user must explicitly approve and scope is limited to approved resources
2. **Given** an approved MCP connection, **When** agent queries data, **Then** communication uses standardized JSON-RPC over secure channel
3. **Given** multiple MCP tools, **When** agent orchestrates workflows, **Then** each tool access is independently authorized

---

### User Story 4 - Agent-to-Agent Collaboration (Priority: P2)

Independent AI agents (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.) can discover and collaborate via A2A protocol on the RustChat platform.

**Why this priority**: Enables complex multi-agent workflows; strategic for enterprise automation.

**Independent Test**: Deploy two agents on different frameworks, verify discovery, negotiation, and task collaboration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** agents A and B on different frameworks, **When** A discovers B via A2A protocol, **Then** capability negotiation completes successfully
2. **Given** negotiated capabilities, **When** agents collaborate on a task, **Then** state is synchronized via RustChat A2A bus
3. **Given** a long-running agent workflow, **When** intermediate results are produced, **Then** progress is observable and resumable

---

### User Story 5 - GDPR-Compliant Data Lifecycle (Priority: P1)

Platform automatically enforces data retention policies and supports Right to Erasure with cryptographic purging.

**Why this priority**: Legal compliance requirement (Constitution XVII); enterprise procurement blocker.

**Independent Test**: Configure retention policy, verify auto-deletion, execute Right to Erasure request, confirm cryptographic wipe.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a 6-month retention policy for applicant data, **When** data ages beyond policy, **Then** automatic hard deletion occurs (no soft delete)
2. **Given** a Right to Erasure request, **When** user confirms deletion, **Then** PostgreSQL VACUUM and file cryptographic wipe execute
3. **Given** deletion execution, **When** checking replicas and backups, **Then** data is purged within configured window

---

### User Story 6 - OpenAPI-Driven API Development (Priority: P2)

All REST APIs are documented in OpenAPI 3.1.1, enabling automated SDK generation and contract-driven development.

**Why this priority**: Developer experience; enables ecosystem integration.

**Independent Test**: Generate OpenAPI spec, validate with linter, generate client SDK, verify against implementation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** API endpoints, **When** OpenAPI 3.1.1 spec is generated, **Then** it passes validation and covers all public endpoints
2. **Given** a valid OpenAPI spec, **When** SDK generator runs, **Then** functional client libraries are produced
3. **Given** spec-first development, **When** spec changes, **Then** implementation contract tests fail appropriately

---

### User Story 7 - Standard Webhooks with HMAC (Priority: P2)

Outbound webhooks follow Standard Webhooks spec with HMAC signature verification and resilient delivery.

**Why this priority**: Integration ecosystem; zero-trust security for external callbacks.

**Independent Test**: Configure webhook endpoint, verify HMAC signatures, test exponential backoff and circuit breaker.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a webhook subscription, **When** an event occurs, **Then** payload includes valid HMAC-SHA256 signature
2. **Given** a failing webhook endpoint, **When** delivery fails, **Then** exponential backoff is applied with circuit breaker after threshold
3. **Given** webhook signature verification, **When** signature is invalid, **Then** payload is rejected before processing

---

### User Story 8 - WCAG 2.1 AA / BITV 2.0 Accessibility (Priority: P1)

Frontend is fully accessible per WCAG 2.1 Level AA and German BITV 2.0 standards.

**Why this priority**: Legal requirement (EU Accessibility Act); Constitution XVIII mandate.

**Independent Test**: Run automated a11y tests, perform screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver), verify keyboard navigation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Solid.js frontend, **When** navigating with keyboard only, **Then** all interactive elements are reachable and operable
2. **Given** a screen reader, **When** page content is announced, **Then** ARIA labels provide meaningful context
3. **Given** color contrast requirements, **When** UI is rendered, **Then** 4.5:1 contrast ratio is maintained throughout

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Kafka broker is unavailable? (Degradation to PostgreSQL fallback)
- How does system handle Redis cluster partition? (Circuit breaker, degraded presence)
- What happens when OIDC IdP is unreachable? (Graceful fallback to cached sessions)
- How are MCP connections secured if external data source is compromised? (Isolation, no platform DB access)
- What happens during a 10x traffic spike beyond provisioned capacity? (Auto-scaling, queue buffering)
